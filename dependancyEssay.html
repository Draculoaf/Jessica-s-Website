      <p>
        The external Javascript library that I have chose to make is a
        slideshow.
      </p>
      <h1>Why a slideshow?</h1>
      <p>
        We that slideshows provide: increased user engagement, a good first
        impression, a way to show all products, a way to convey information in
        an easily digestible way, and a call to action (Mishina, 2019) and (SKT
        Themes, 2021).This means that slideshows are a way to grab the attention
        of a user and ask them to engage with your site by clicking through the
        slideshow. As the users click through the slideshow, they can get to
        know all the projects I have been working on, and perhaps they may
        become more interested in other works I have done. Additionally, the
        slideshow enhances the excitement about and engagement with the
        timeline. A user may see a project that they think looks interesting and
        seek it out within my Itch.io profile or through my timeline links – the
        slideshow is thus all about convincing my viewers that they want to find
        out more about me, what I’ve done and where they can try out my projects
        for themselves.
      </p>
      <h1>What are the alternatives?</h1>
      <p>
        Slides shows are not always effective. They can pose accessibility
        issues if they rotate automatically and because screen readers struggle
        to read them, slideshows are often missed by users, and are sometimes
        associated with junk content such as advertisements (Fisher, 2018) and
        (Stanley, 2021). Some alternatives to the slideshow could have been to
        use columns (like in a newspaper) because it presents all the
        information at once, and the users know what to expect meaning that they
        might engage more. Additionally, an engaging video, videos, or specific
        landing pages for targeted audiences are good alternatives. I feel that
        a video would have been the most suitable alternative because if I chose
        to use an image grid, I feel that it would have made the timeline
        obsolete. I feel that a slideshow was the most useful feature to add
        because the timeline does not have any engagement, and the slideshow
        provides only a “taster” for the projects I have made without being
        overwhelming.
      </p>
      <h1>The challenges</h1>
      <p>
        The main challenge with building something like this is the JavaScript.
        I do not personally feel like I have the confidence to implement these
        features and edit them on a good enough level. Unlike CSS and HTML, it
        is much more difficult to know exactly what goes wrong. Additionally, JS
        does not give you as much feedback and the actual language feels much
        less obvious to use. In CSS, you know exactly what “color” does, or
        “text-align”, whereas in JS seeing something like “let potatoes = [];”
        is much more mysterious. Another challenge for me, due to the lack of
        confidence, is that it takes a lot of time to implement even simple
        functions. Of course, this means that I have much less time to do
        everything else in my project.
