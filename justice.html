      <h4>What is design justice?</h4>
      <p>
        To properly understand this word and how we can apply to other contexts,
        we will begin by defining justice and design. Design is the
        implementation of an activity which results in a product. Designs
        satisfy goals and consider constraints. Justice is the philosophical
        concept used to describe the principle in which people receive what they
        deserve. This usually entails categorising goods and evils. So, design
        justice must then mean the designing of a product or the process of
        designing a product in which the designer considers the effects of their
        product on society.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What are some problems on the internet, in society and in designs?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The internet is a product consisting of the creation and transfer of
        data often through algorithms (see my blog about URLs and Metadata for
        more). We have become so used to the internet that we don’t often stop
        to think about who is creating the things we see and how that might
        affect our perception of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Birhane et al. (2019) “algorithmic tools embed and
        perpetuate societal and historical biases and injustice […because] any
        tool we create and deploy is intimately tied with the nature of being
        and morality.” In other words, the things we create will reflect the
        biases we have, even if we don’t realise it, and those biases could
        cause injustices to occur. For example, in products, we might forget to
        design for people with disabilities because we ourselves are not
        surrounded by it. This creates an exclusion of a group of people from
        using your product.
      </p>
      <p>
        So where does the content we see on the internet come from? Evidence
        from Graham et al. (2016) would suggest that most of the content on the
        internet is made and shared by the global north. This predominantly
        consists of North America, Europe and Asia. When one group of people are
        able to control the knowledge system in a society, then their views and
        narratives are pushes onto everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the age of information, being able to connect to the internet is a
        valuable even necessary resource to have. However, according to Tataki
        et al. (2020), 50% or about 830 million of students who needed access to
        these facilities to study, did not have access to a computer. This
        digital divide emphasises how disproportionately vulnerable people are
        affected.
      </p>
      <h4>How do we design justly?</h4>
      <p>
        Designing justly will mean that we have to start including more
        varieties of people when we are creating products! The more perspectives
        one has, the better it can be and the better it can serve society.
