        Thoughts during and after website iteration four
      </header>
      <article class="h-entry">
        <p>
          The main changes that happened in the forth iteration of this site
          included: changing the design page into cards, and linking the cards
          to new pages which were designed to look the same as the blog posts.
          Having the same look helps to set up conventions for the users, but I
          also think that it makes the site look more uniform and professional.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second major change of the site, is the addition of the slideshow
          on the home page. With this slideshow, I hope to make the viewer more
          enticed to click on the links in the timeline, and have them feel more
          interested in what I do overall.
