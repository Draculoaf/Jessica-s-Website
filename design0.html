        Thoughts during and after website iteration one
      </header>
      <article class="h-entry">
        <p>
          This initial design's colours are inspried by National Geographic. I
          chose this site because of the darker colours they use which makes the
          website feel more modern and professional, however, I do feel like
          white text against a black background makes the content difficult to
          read. To combat this, I chose to make the background a lighter grey.
          The homepage currently looks the nicest to me. I think that the gold
          and white pops out against the grey background, but I do think that
          the Linkedin symbol on the profile part does look out of place, in
          fact, I would say that the profile does not blend into the timeline as
          seemlessly as I would have liked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I chose to change the positiion of my navigation bar to
          be on the homepage to the top (see week one wireframes). I felt like
          this was the better decision because users might not open the website
          on the home page, and might become confused to see that the navigation
          bar is suddenly in the middle of the page. The navigation bar no
          longer uses pictures to represent the webstie's pages, this is because
          there are no conventional symbols for any of the pages contained
          within the site (excluding the homepage).
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently in this interation, the blog section does feel like a wall
          of text (as users tend to scroll by the short blurbs and pictures I
          provided), however, in the second iteration of this website, I plan to
          add a "read more" and "read less" button using Javascript.
          Furthermore, I plan to change the colours of the site as I currently
          feel like the website feels very gloomy and dull. The hyperlinks
          within the paragaphs also struggles to stand out, and I had to use a
          darker more orange colour instead of the gold seem throughout the
          site.

        <p>
          With regards to making the site, I felt that the HTML was actually
          more fun than the CSS. This might be due to the fact that I did the
          HTML much further in advance (if you see, I started this project about
          a month before it was due) and so was able to get more help for it,
          whereas I did the CSS in a more time pressure enviroment. When making
          a website, the more time you have, the more effectively you can do
          things - an important and universal lesson when making anything is to
          avoid procrastination. Overall, I actually really enjoy the technical
          coding of websites, and this might be due to how easy it is to format
          the code with the help of Prettier.

          When I was creating this site, I began with the HTML. I was
          particularly pedantic about the semantic markup. Not only because I
          obviously want to get the most traffic as possible onto my site, but
          also because, as Andre showed us, it becomes an accesibility
          advantage. I was less meticulous about the microformats, and this was
          largely due to when the lecture for it was released. By the time I
          wanted to add it, I was already in that assignment time pressure mode.
          Additionally, I found it much harder to implement since I wasn't
          entirely sure exactly where to put it - a note to self, I don't like
          going back and adding more things, just do it well the first time. The
          CSS was last, and where I spent majority of my time. I hated it.
          Nothing looked as nice as I would have hoped, and why is it so
          difficult to align images? In future, I would probably try to move
          quickly through the HTML and focus on the CSS.
