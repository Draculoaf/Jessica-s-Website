        In *The Medium is the Message*, I think it is really fascinating how
        McLuhan already predicted that technology would create “villages”. I
        think this really points to the idea of fandoms, or in this case, groups
        of people who all believe in something similar - good or bad, person or
        theory. In FVPA, we learned that facts are (and this is a very
        simplistic breakdown of the idea) theories or ideas which majority of
        the population, or people in a particular society at a particular time,
        agree upon. Does this not mean that, in essence, truth is relative to
        the theories you surround yourself with and the time period you live in?
        To use McLuhan’s quote from C.G. Jung “[...] Because living constantly
        in the atmosphere of slaves, he became infected through the unconscious
        with their psychology. No one can shield him from such an influence.” To
        follow on from this, I believe that these “villages” create the perfect
        environment for misinformation to be spread. For example, the myth that
        one swallows spiders in their sleep was used as a “fact” to prove how
        gullible and susceptible people are to misinformation. “In a 1993 *PC
        Professional* article, columnist Lisa Holst wrote about the ubiquitous
        lists of “facts” that were circulating via e-mail and how readily they
        were accepted as truthful by gullible recipients. To demonstrate her
        point, Holst offered her own made-up list of equally ridiculous “facts,”
        among which was the statistic cited above about the average person’s
        swallowing eight spiders per year, which she took from a collection of
        common misbeliefs printed in a 1954 book on insect folklore. In a
        delicious irony, Holst’s propagation of this false “fact” has spurred it
        into becoming one of the most widely-circulated bits of misinformation
        to be found on the Internet.” I also think that McLuhan was very spot on
        when he said that “technology is capturing us and holding us like
        prisoners in a jail without walls.” This very much feels like a hint
        towards the addiction we see to phones, video games, etc. Facebook and
        other social media platforms like TikTok, create their apps to be
        extremely addictive due to how easily they are to keep consuming
        content. Think about how Youtube suggests more videos to watch, or how
        Instagram can let you endlessly scroll for new content in the discovery
        page. Of course, technology and technological advancements are not
        inherently bad, “The products of modern science are not in themselves
        good or bad; it is the way they are used which determines their value”
        (McLuhan, 1964), but it seems that companies, particularly due to (I
        assume) capitalism, use technology to keep you *needing* more content
        from them. Read more about this here:

        Overall, I think that this just shows how crucial it is for us, as new
        designers, to be aware of things such as stereotypes, biases, etc.
        because negative content which is consumed by the unwary or ignorant,
        can harm the *human* empathy that people should have for one another. We
        *need* to do better and we cannot let bad things remain the way they
        are, *especially* when we have the power to change it.
