            The Medium is the Message - Marshall McLuhan (1964)

          In *The Medium is the Message*, I think it is really fascinating how
          McLuhan already predicted that technology would create “villages”. I
          think this really points to the idea of fandoms, or in this case,
          groups of people who all believe in something similar - good or bad,
          person or theory. In FVPA, we learned that facts are (and this is a
          very simplistic breakdown of the idea) theories or ideas which
          majority of the population, or people in a particular society at a
          particular time, agree upon. Does this not mean that, in essence,
          truth is relative to the theories you surround yourself with and the
          time period you live in? To use McLuhan’s quote from C.G. Jung “[...]
          Because living constantly in the atmosphere of slaves, he became
          infected through the unconscious with their psychology. No one can
          shield him from such an influence.” To follow on from this, I believe
          that these “villages” create the perfect environment for
          misinformation to be spread. For example, the myth that one swallows
          spiders in their sleep was used as a “fact” to prove how gullible and
          susceptible people are to misinformation. “In a 1993 *PC
          Professional* article, columnist Lisa Holst wrote about the ubiquitous
          lists of “facts” that were circulating via e-mail and how readily they
          were accepted as truthful by gullible recipients. To demonstrate her
          point, Holst offered her own made-up list of equally ridiculous
          “facts,” among which was the statistic cited above about the average
          person’s swallowing eight spiders per year, which she took from a
          collection of common misbeliefs printed in a 1954 book on insect
          folklore. In a delicious irony, Holst’s propagation of this false
          “fact” has spurred it into becoming one of the most widely-circulated
          bits of misinformation to be found on the Internet.” I also think that
          McLuhan was very spot on when he said that “technology is capturing us
          and holding us like prisoners in a jail without walls.” This very much
          feels like a hint towards the addiction we see to phones, video games,
          etc. Facebook and other social media platforms like TikTok, create
          their apps to be extremely addictive due to how easily they are to
          keep consuming content. Think about how Youtube suggests more videos
          to watch, or how Instagram can let you endlessly scroll for new
          content in the discovery page. Of course, technology and technological
          advancements are not inherently bad, “The products of modern science
          are not in themselves good or bad; it is the way they are used which
          determines their value” (McLuhan, 1964), but it seems that companies,
          particularly due to (I assume) capitalism, use technology to keep you
          *needing* more content from them. Read more about this here:

          Overall, I think that this just shows how crucial it is for us, as new
          designers, to be aware of things such as stereotypes, biases, etc.
          because negative content which is consumed by the unwary or ignorant,
          can harm the *human* empathy that people should have for one another.
          We *need* to do better and we cannot let bad things remain the way
          they are, *especially* when we have the power to change it.

          What is a URL? URL stands for uniform resource locator, and on a
          website the URL is the specific location of a video, file, page, etc.
          on the internet. Sir Tim Berners-Lee was accredited with the coinage
          of this term, and in 1994 the URL was suggested a standard by Lee.
          Interestingly, URLs were created based on the concept of hypertext, a
          term coined by Theodore Holm Nelson in 1963, where information or
          specific parts in a website/piece of text were linked to others.
          Components of a URL and what do they do? A URL comprises of three
          parts: the protocol, domain name, and finally, path. At the beginning
          of a URL, there is the *protocol.* On most websites, this would be the
          HTTP, HHTPS or even the less common FTP. The protocol formats the
          information (data) it receives into something understandable and
          meaningful, thus telling the browser how to communicate with a
          website’s server, in order to send a retrieve information. Followed by
          this is the *domain name*. This is the identifier for a specific site,
          and usually brings you to the home page if no path is added on. The
          domain name usually ends with a top level domain (TLD) for example,
          .com, .org, .co.za, etc. When you enter the domain name in your web
          browser, the servers on the domain name system (DNS) lookup name
          servers associated with the domain. When your request reaches the web
          server, it fetches the web page along with pieces of information
          associated with it. The domain name can also begin with xn. This
          indicates that the original characters were changed into a domain name
          compatible with the DNS Finally, at the end is the *path* (as known as
          the URL slug). Each page or file on a website has it’s own path, and
          this part of the URL takes you directly to that information. Paths
          comprise of many symbols which indicate various things: - A forward
          slash indicates a subfolder - A question mark indicates a query by the
          user, and multiple queries are separated by ampersands - A hashtag
          indicates a specific place on a website You may also find that there
          is percent encoding in the path. This means that the original
          characters have been changed. For example, a $ sign will change to
          %24.
