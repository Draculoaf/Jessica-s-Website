        A Reflection on the UX and UI In My Website

      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        UX and UI are concepts used to describe why design choices are made and
        how those choices affect the user. More specifically, UX (user
        experience) is the experience evoked when a user uses a product in which
        user experience design considers all the elements which effect this
        experience. Thus, it is the quality of an interaction which a user
        experiences. For example, how easy is it to use a product, how easy is
        it for users to get what they want to form the product? On the other
        hand, UI (user interface) focuses on the presentation and interactivity
        of the product. UI considers, colours, typography, spacing and
        responsive design (Lamprecht, 2002).

      <h4>UX in motion</h4>
      <h5>The good stuff</h5>
      <p>
        This will be done primarily by look at Peta Goldberg’s A Crash Course in
        User Experience and Interface Design and the UX theories therein.
      </p>
      <p>
        Restorff Effect: “When multiple similar objects are present, one that
        differs from the rest is most likely remembered.” I think that I have
        somewhat done this within my website. Firstly, by making my link words
        different colours ie. It says find the article “here”, and the here is a
        link. And secondly, through some of the UI elements such as the scroll
        bar, the back to top button in the design page and by highlighting the
        name of the active page in the navigation bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Position Effect: “Users have a propensity to best remember first and
        last items in a series.” In my blog post pages I think I have done this
        very well. The title of the blog is at the top of the page and the date
        it was written is at the bottom – both are information which I think is
        important.
      </p>
      <h5>The bad stuff</h5>
      <p>
        I think one of the pages on my site which gives users the worst
        experience must be blog post page and the design page. Even though I
        don’t think the design page is that bad, I will say that both pages are
        filled with long pages of text, and poorly aligned images (if any). I
        think these things are most prevalent when one views my website on the
        phone. The images because squashed and overlap, and the text seems
        infinitely longer. In general, I frown upon my navigation bar and how it
        looks when a user sees my website on their phone. The bottom half of it
        (with the page names) stays in a fixed position if the menu is not
        closed again. One way that I think I can make the experience better on
        these pages might be, on cell phone view, have a progress bar so that
        users get a sense of progress. This is also the Zeigarnik Effect.
        Overall, it seems like it is mostly because my UX on a smaller device
        than a laptop has been poorly considered/implemented.

      <h4>UI in motion</h4>
      <p>
        This will be done primarily by look at Peta Goldberg’s A Crash Course in
        User Experience and Interface Design and the design theories therein.
      </p>
      <h5>The bad stuff</h5>
      <p>
        We will begin with the bad UI first because this will follow along as to
        why I think my UX is bad/worse than necessary. UX and UI are layered
        design decisions which all contribute to the feel, experience and
        enjoyment of a product. One of the contributing reasons as to why I
        think my blog post pages and my design page is because of the long
        texts. The entire post is in the same text and has no pictures – this,
        to me, makes it difficult to read and detracts from my enjoyment.
        Additionally, the navigation bar in small devices modes is not
        consistent. Sometimes the options are aligned in the centre and in other
        pages it is slightly off.
      </p>
      <h5>The good stuff</h5>

      <p>
        Text: I chose my text to be sans-serif because this is the text which is
        apparently most easy for dyslexic people to read. All the lines in the
        text paragraphs begin at the same point, and the background colours of
        these parts are not white so there is not stark contrast between the
        background and the text, these things make it more comfortable to read
        on my site. In the blog posts, the text is in the centre and has padding
        around it for some radial symmetry. For visual weight, I think this is
        much more appealing to see and interact with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Colour: I think I did well with my colour palette. It feels very warm,
        and I think I made good choices for the colours of things I want to
        emphasise. For example my timeline which is aligned in the centre but
        asymmetrical, stands out really nicely against the peachy background. I
        also think that the gold against the white is quite nice.
      </p>
      <h4>Other stuff</h4>
      <p>
        When I was reading the 2009 article from Luis Francisco-Revilla and Jeff
        Crow, 'Interpreting the layout of web pages', I was able to identify the
        type of layout of my website.I would say that it is a modular layout.
        This means:
      </p>
      <p class="p-quote">
        [Modular layouts] use a combination of vertical and horizontal shapes to
        package the information. Modular layouts provide a clean and simple
        appearance, improve legibility, save time in the production process,
        provide significant advertising advantages, and, more importantly,
        readers prefer them.
      </p>
      <p>
        To me, this substantiates some of the design choices I unknowingly made,
        and helps me to believe that my goal of the website (to have it be
        professional, simple, and easy to use) has been achieved through the
        layout.
