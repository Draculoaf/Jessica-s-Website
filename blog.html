          The Medium is the Message - Marshall McLuhan (1964)

      <article class="h-entry">
        <p>
          In *The Medium is the Message*, I think it is really fascinating how
          McLuhan already predicted that technology would create “villages”. I
          think this really points to the idea of fandoms, or in this case,
          groups of people who all believe in something similar - good or bad,
          person or theory<span id="dots">...</span>
          <span id="more">
            In FVPA, we learned that facts are (and this is a very simplistic
            breakdown of the idea) theories or ideas which majority of the
            population, or people in a particular society at a particular time,
            agree upon. Does this not mean that, in essence, truth is relative
            to the theories you surround yourself with and the time period you
            live in? To use McLuhan’s quote from C.G. Jung “[...] Because living
            constantly in the atmosphere of slaves, he became infected through
            the unconscious with their psychology. No one can shield him from
            such an influence.” To follow on from this, I believe that these
            “villages” create the perfect environment for misinformation to be
            spread. For example, the myth that one swallows spiders in their
            sleep was used as a “fact” to prove how gullible and susceptible
            people are to misinformation. “In a 1993 *PC Professional* article,
            columnist Lisa Holst wrote about the ubiquitous lists of “facts”
            that were circulating via e-mail and how readily they were accepted
            as truthful by gullible recipients. To demonstrate her point, Holst
            offered her own made-up list of equally ridiculous “facts,” among
            which was the statistic cited above about the average person’s
            swallowing eight spiders per year, which she took from a collection
            of common misbeliefs printed in a 1954 book on insect folklore. In a
            delicious irony, Holst’s propagation of this false “fact” has
            spurred it into becoming one of the most widely-circulated bits of
            misinformation to be found on the Internet.” I also think that
            McLuhan was very spot on when he said that “technology is capturing
            us and holding us like prisoners in a jail without walls.” This very
            much feels like a hint towards the addiction we see to phones, video
            games, etc. Facebook and other social media platforms like TikTok,
            create their apps to be extremely addictive due to how easily they
            are to keep consuming content. Think about how Youtube suggests more
            videos to watch, or how Instagram can let you endlessly scroll for
            new content in the discovery page. Of course, technology and
            technological advancements are not inherently bad, “The products of
            modern science are not in themselves good or bad; it is the way they
            are used which determines their value” (McLuhan, 1964), but it seems
            that companies, particularly due to (I assume) capitalism, use
            technology to keep you *needing* more content from them. Read more

            target="_blank" >here Overall, I think that this just shows how
            crucial it is for us, as new designers, to be aware of things such
            as stereotypes, biases, etc. because negative content which is
            consumed by the unwary or ignorant, can harm the *human* empathy
            that people should have for one another. We *need* to do better and
            we cannot let bad things remain the way they are, *especially* when
            we have the power to change it.

          What are URLs and how do they work?

        <h4>What is a URL?</h4>
        <p>
          URL stands for uniform resource locator, and on a website the URL is
          the specific location of a video, file, page, etc. on the internet.
          Sir Tim Berners-Lee was accredited with the coinage of this term, and
          in 1994 the URL was suggested a standard by Lee. Interestingly, URLs
          were created based on the concept of hypertext, a term coined by
          Theodore Holm Nelson in 1963, where information or specific parts in a
          website/piece of text were linked to others<span id="dots">...</span>
          <span id="more">
            Components of a URL and what do they do?: A URL comprises of three
            parts: the protocol, domain name, and finally, path. At the
            beginning of a URL, there is the *protocol.* On most websites, this
            would be the HTTP, HHTPS or even the less common FTP. The protocol
            formats the information (data) it receives into something
            understandable and meaningful, thus telling the browser how to
            communicate with a website’s server, in order to send a retrieve
            information. Followed by this is the *domain name*. This is the
            identifier for a specific site, and usually brings you to the home
            page if no path is added on. The domain name usually ends with a top
            level domain (TLD) for example, .com, .org, .co.za, etc. When you
            enter the domain name in your web browser, the servers on the domain
            name system (DNS) lookup name servers associated with the domain.
            When your request reaches the web server, it fetches the web page
            along with pieces of information associated with it. The domain name
            can also begin with xn. This indicates that the original characters
            were changed into a domain name compatible with the DNS Finally, at
            the end is the *path* (as known as the URL slug). Each page or file
            on a website has it’s own path, and this part of the URL takes you
            directly to that information. Paths comprise of many symbols which
            indicate various things: A forward slash indicates a subfolder, A
            question mark indicates a query by the user, and multiple queries
            are separated by ampersands, A hashtag indicates a specific place on
            a website You may also find that there is percent encoding in the
            path. This means that the original characters have been changed. For
            example, a $ sign will change to %24. Thoughts: Because URLs
            specifically show us results based on what webcrawlers can find, it
            is important to think about what content you are accessing and who
            is creating that content, and we know that countries such as America
            and England are dominating when it comes to content creation. This
            leads to techno-colonialsm, which is a term coined by Randy Bush in
            2015 to describe the phenomenon of "the exploitation of poorer
            cultures by richer ones through technology". If technology is passed
            through a knowledge system, and the knowledge of technology requires
            a codification or verbalisation to be effectively used and
            understood, then what does that mean for those who do not have
            access to this knowledge? In the digital age, this gap between those
            who can and know how to use technology is emphasised. Job
            opportunites, health care systems, and other things which are solely
            based online cannot be used by a big portion of the world.

        <h4>What is metadata?</h4>
        <p>
          “Metadata is simply data about data. It means it is a description and
          context of the data. It helps to organize, find and understand data”
          (Kononow, 2018). For example, when we look at a blog page, the URL,
          title, author and date all provide meatdata about the blog’s content.
          <span id="dots">...</span>
          <span id="more">
            Types of metadata: There are three main types of metadata:
            structural, administritive, and descrptitive. Structural metadata
            indicates how a digital assest is organised (eg. a table of
            contents), and more than this; structural metadata indicates the
            type of relationship between two assest. For exmaple, it could
            inidcate an edited photo versus an unedited one. Administritive
            metadata stores data about a digital asset. Administritive metadata
            can be broken up into three catagories (as per the National
            Information Standards Organization (NISO)), namely: technical,
            preservation and rights metadata. Descrptitive metadata helps us to
            discover and identify digital assests. In HTML, this would be at the
            beginning of the page and indicate things such asthe language of the
            website, what other scripts the page is linked to, etc. Thoughts:
            When it comes to making a website, metadata can become invaluable.
            Espeically descriptive data in HTML. Semantic elements and
            microformats are ways in which a designer could bring more traffic
            to their site. This is because webcrawlers search for key words when
            they recieve search requests, hence, if a designer uses as many
            relative keywords as possible, the webcrawler is more likely to
            suggest their site. Not only this, but having semantic rich HTML
            makes it easier for webreaders to go through your website - a big
            advantage for people with disabilities.
