        Thoughts during and after website iteration two

        <p>
          The first thing that I changed, we for my navbar to be more responsive
          to screen resizing. One problem here which I found is that the options
          in the nav bar don't format themselves as I would like. In other
          words, instead of it being a list which goes vertically down, it is
          instead a list which remains horizontal. I really would have liked it
          to be vertical since this is the convention for sites which you can
          use on a mobile device, it also would be beneficial so I could add my
          social media links there instead of making them disappear altogether.

          I changed the colour scheme of my website. Whilst grey and white (like
          my National Geographic example) might seem very modern, sleek and
          professional, I also felt like it looked dull and cold. in saying
          this, I came across another website which I thought did really well in
          feeling cozy, but also when I read through their articles, my eyes
          didn't burn, the interface was also easy to navigate through. Take a
          look at it

          You may have noticed that The home page has been slightly redesigned.
          I felt like my profile description and photo of me was out of place
          being placed before the timeline. I thought it would be nice to
          incorporate it into the timeline instead.You will notice that it goes
          against my original idea of having my latest works at the top. This is
          because I feel like users are very unlikely to want to scroll down to
          the bottom and then scroll all the way up if they wanted to see my
          progress. It also feels more like a story when you read the timeline
          from top to bottom, and to see how my game develop. You'll notice that
          my social media links are now in the navigation bar, but only on one
          page. I did this because, to me, a person interested in connecting
          with me would come to my home page and "get to know me", whereas in
          the design or blog page, it may feel arbitrary. Additionally, I
          uploaded my games to Itch.io so that users can download the content
          from a safer platform, additionally, I made my CV open in a new tab so
          that users can scroll through it without having an unnecessary
          download.The descriptions and titles in the timeline have been made to
          be much fun and exciting. I really wanted to use it as an opportunity
          to make users feel more comfortable with me and get a shine of my
          personality - especially since I removed the initial description I had
          of myself.

          In my original idea for adding javascript to my website, I wanted the
          blog to have a read more and read less function, however, this did not
          work out efficiently with my programming, I was also advised to rather
          send the user to a new tab to read articles because it looks more
          visually appealing. In my blog post pages, I wanted to add "go back"
          and "go forward" buttons, but I found that it was actually easier to
          just open a new tab for the user. I felt like it would make navigation
          easier because the user wouldn't need to go back through many pages to
          get where they originally were. Plus, it allows users to open many
          blogs and easily navigate through them.This is partially why I omitted
          the nav bar from the blog post pages. I didn't want users to go back
          and forth to new articles, I wanted them to rather to close the tabs
          when they were done. A fun feature I added to my website in the blog
          page was the random article generator. I would have optimally wanted
          it to actually take the user to the blog page as opposed to just
          giving the names of the articles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because my design page is very long to scroll through, I decided to
          add a "back to top" button so that users could easily navigate out of
          the page. For a similar reason, I added the scroll bar back for users
          who have wonky mice (looks at Hanli).
        </p>

          In terms of coding, I felt like I sturggled a lot more with javascript
          and needed a lot more guidance. But from interation one's feedback, I
          have changed the naming conventions to be more consistent, and I added
          some more semantic markup/microformat where I had previously missed
          some. Additionally, I tried to focus less on CSS and more on theory
          because that is actually where I scored the lowest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have kept some of my initial design wants such as using a sans
          serriff font for ultimate readablilty, a background colour on larger
          texts which makes it easier for the user to read long paragraphs
          (somewhat like reader mode), and still a design which feels cozy,
          homey and professional.
