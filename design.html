          For my first wireframes of my website, I really am focusing on
          allowing the user to move through my website without having to type or
          go through complicated tabs to find simple information. In my
          homepage, you first see the profile bar at the top which has a photo
          about me, a short bio to get personal and a LinkedIn link. This is
          because my website is about me, so I want people to really get a sense
          of who I am, what I do, etc. I also feel like adding a photo and bio
          at the top of the bar creates a very personal feeling and I hope feels
          very welcoming. Because I want the viewers to get to know me, I also
          think that I want to put a timeline of my works (portfolio) so that
          people can see how much I have grown. There is two tabs to bring the
          user to my latest works (because it is going to be at the bottom of my
          timeline) OR the timeline will just go the other way and have my most
          recent works at the top. My page then has a navigation bar which is
          mostly pictures because I find that this is a much more appealing way
          of navigating through a website, as opposed to going through a bunch
          of categories, and because the things going on the website are simple;
          confusion can more easily be avoided. For the blog posts, I based it
          off of the Twitter design. Each post will have a title and picture of
          the author and with a “read more” function, the user can enlarge the
          post to see more text. My design page will work in a similar style
          except It might be a different colour heading from the blog posts - we
          are yet to see. Overall, I don’t want users to be met with a wall of
          text, and I want them to easily be able to traverse the space.

          This week's wireframes' colours are inspried by National Geographic. I
          chose this site because of the darker colours they use which makes the
          website feel more modern and professional, however, I do feel like
          white text against a black background makes the content difficult to
          read. To combat this, I chose to make the background a lighter grey. I
          also chose to change the positiion of my navigation bar on the
          homepage to the top (see week one wireframes).I felt like this was the
          better decision because users might not open the website on the home
          page, and might become confused to see that the navigation bar is
          suddenly in the middle of the page.
