            For my first wireframes of my website, I really am focusing on
            allowing the user to move through my website without having to type
            or go through complicated tabs to find simple information. In my
            homepage, you first see the profile bar at the top which has a photo
            about me, a short bio to get personal and a LinkedIn link. This is
            because my website is about me, so I want people to really get a
            sense of who I am, what I do, etc. I think that having the short
            descirption of me written in my handwriting would make it even more
            personal. I also feel like adding a photo and bio at the top of the
            bar creates a very familiar feeling and I hope feels very welcoming.
            <a class="u-link" href="http://s4x.stationfour.com/" target="_blank"
              >This</a
            >
            is what I am aiming for my homepage portfolio to look like.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because I want the viewers to get to know me, I also think that I
            want to put a timeline of my works (portfolio) so that people can
            see how much I have grown. There is two tabs to bring the user to my
            latest works (because it is going to be at the bottom of my
            timeline) OR the timeline will just go the other way and have my
            most recent works at the top. This is a site which I want to be
            professional (in the sense that I woud want to put this site into my
            portfolio for potential employers to see) so I want to base my
            colours from National Geographics' website. This means the main
            colours are going to be gold, white and black.
          </p>
          <p>
            My page then has a navigation bar which is mostly pictures because I
            find that this is a much more appealing way of navigating through a
            website, as opposed to going through a bunch of categories, and
            because the things going on the website are simple; confusion can
            more easily be avoided. For the blog posts, I based it off of the
            Twitter design. Each post will have a title and picture of the
            author and with a “read more” function, the user can enlarge the
            post to see more text. My design page will work in a similar style
            except It might be a different colour heading from the blog posts -
            we are yet to see. Overall, I don’t want users to be met with a wall
            of text, and I want them to easily be able to traverse the space.
            The overall text of the site should be a sans-serrif font because
            this is the easiest font to read.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, I am creating my website with the idea that users should
            not have to search through my navigation bar to find things (this is
            uder the hopes that the site will become easier to navigate, and
            become more "addicting" to stay on), I chose my colour scheme to
            match National Geographic because they have created a website which
            makes the content stand out in a professional, clean, and
            non-overwhelming way, and finally I chose my font to be a
            sans-serrif font because it has the most readability.

        <header class="article-title">
          Thoughts during and after website iteration one
        </header>
        <article class="h-entry">
          <p>
            This initial design's colours are inspried by National Geographic. I
            chose this site because of the darker colours they use which makes
            the website feel more modern and professional, however, I do feel
            like white text against a black background makes the content
            difficult to read. To combat this, I chose to make the background a
            lighter grey. The homepage currently looks the nicest to me. I think
            that the gold and white pops out against the grey background, but I
            do think that the Linkedin symbol on the profile part does look out
            of place, in fact, I would say that the profile does not blend into
            the timeline as seemlessly as I would have liked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, I chose to change the positiion of my navigation bar
            to be on the homepage to the top (see week one wireframes). I felt
            like this was the better decision because users might not open the
            website on the home page, and might become confused to see that the
            navigation bar is suddenly in the middle of the page. The navigation
            bar no longer uses pictures to represent the webstie's pages, this
            is because there are no conventional symbols for any of the pages
            contained within the site (excluding the homepage).
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently in this interation, the blog section does feel like a wall
            of text (as users tend to scroll by the short blurbs and pictures I
            provided), however, in the second iteration of this website, I plan
            to add a "read more" and "read less" button using Javascript.
            Furthermore, I plan to change the colours of the site as I currently
            feel like the website feels very gloomy and dull. The hyperlinks
            within the paragaphs also struggles to stand out, and I had to use a
            darker more orange colour instead of the gold seem throughout the
            site.
          </p>
          <p>
            With regards to making the site, I felt that the HTML was actually
            more fun than the CSS. This might be due to the fact that I did the
            HTML much further in advance (if you see, I started this project
            about a month before it was due) and so was able to get more help
            for it, whereas I did the CSS in a more time pressure enviroment.
            When making a website, the more time you have, the more effectively
            you can do things - an important and universal lesson when making
            anything is to avoid procrastination. Overall, I actually really
            enjoy the technical coding of websites, and this might be due to how
            easy it is to format the code with the help of Prettier.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was creating this site, I began with the HTML. I was
            particularly pedantic about the semantic markup. Not only because I
            obviously want to get the most traffic as possible onto my site, but
            also because, as Andre showed us, it becomes an accesibility
            advantage. I was less meticulous about the microformats, and this
            was largely due to when the lecture for it was released. By the time
            I wanted to add it, I was already in that assignment time pressure
            mode. Additionally, I found it much harder to implement since I
            wasn't entirely sure exactly where to put it - a note to self, I
            don't like going back and adding more things, just do it well the
            first time. The CSS was last, and where I spent majority of my time.
            I hated it. Nothing looked as nice as I would have hoped, and why is
            it so difficult to align images? In future, I would probably try to
            move quickly through the HTML and focus on the CSS.

            The first thing that I changed, we for my navbar to be more
            responsive to screen resizing. One problem here which I found is
            that the options in the nav bar don't format themselves as I would
            like. In other words, instead of it being a list which goes
            vertically down, it is instead a list which remains horizontal. I
            really would have liked it to be vertical since this is the
            convention for sites which you can use on a mobile device, it also
            would be beneficial so I could add my social media links there
            instead of making them disappear altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            I changed the colour scheme of my website. Whilst grey and white
            (like my National Geographic example) might seem very modern, sleek
            and professional, I also felt like it looked dull and cold. in
            saying this, I came across another website which I thought did
            really well in feeling cozy, but also when I read through their
            articles, my eyes didn't burn, the interface was also easy to
            navigate through. Take a look at it
            <a
              class="u-link"
              href="https://www.jennifermag.com/issues"

              >here</a

            or see the image I attached below.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may have noticed that The home page has been slightly
            redesigned. I felt like my profile description and photo of me was
            out of place being placed before the timeline. I thought it would be
            nice to incorporate it into the timeline instead.You will notice
            that it goes against my original idea of having my latest works at
            the top. This is because I feel like users are very unlikely to want
            to scroll down to the bottom and then scroll all the way up if they
            wanted to see my progress. It also feels more like a story when you
            read the timeline from top to bottom, and to see how my game
            develop. You'll notice that my social media links are now in the
            navigation bar, but only on one page. I did this because, to me, a
            person interested in connecting with me would come to my home page
            and "get to know me", whereas in the design or blog page, it may
            feel arbitrary. Additionally, I uploaded my games to Itch.io so that
            users can download the content from a safer platform, additionally,
            I made my CV open in a new tab so that users can scroll through it
            without having an unnecessary download.The descriptions and titles
            in the timeline have been made to be much fun and exciting. I really
            wanted to use it as an opportunity to make users feel more
            comfortable with me and get a shine of my personality - especially
            since I removed the initial description I had of myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my original idea for adding javascript to my website, I wanted
            the blog to have a read more and read less function, however, this
            did not work out efficiently with my programming, I was also advised
            to rather send the user to a new tab to read articles because it
            looks more visually appealing. In my blog post pages, I wanted to
            add "go back" and "go forward" buttons, but I found that it was
            actually easier to just open a new tab for the user. I felt like it
            would make navigation easier because the user wouldn't need to go
            back through many pages to get where they originally were. Plus, it
            allows users to open many blogs and easily navigate through
            them.This is partially why I omitted the nav bar from the blog post
            pages. I didn't want users to go back and forth to new articles, I
            wanted them to rather to close the tabs when they were done. A fun
            feature I added to my website in the blog page was the random
            article generator. I would have optimally wanted it to actually take
            the user to the blog page as opposed to just giving the names of the
            articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because my design page is very long to scroll through, I decided to
            add a "back to top" button so that users could easily navigate out
            of the page. For a similar reason, I added the scroll bar back for
            users who have wonky mice (looks at Hanli).
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of coding, I felt like I sturggled a lot more with
            javascript and needed a lot more guidance. But from interation one's
            feedback, I have changed the naming conventions to be more
            consistent, and I added some more semantic markup/microformat where
            I had previously missed some. Additionally, I tried to focus less on
            CSS and more on theory because that is actually where I scored the
            lowest.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have kept some of my initial design wants such as using a sans
            serriff font for ultimate readablilty, a background colour on larger
            texts which makes it easier for the user to read long paragraphs
            (somewhat like reader mode), and still a design which feels cozy,
            homey and professional.
