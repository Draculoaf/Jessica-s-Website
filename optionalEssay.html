        Technological determinism was first coined by Thorstein Veblen, and his
        theory around technological determinism is that technology defines a
        society’s nature, thus technology is a major influencer of society’s
        culture, and it can determine history. Langdon Winner describes the
        theory in a similar way with his two hypotheses. The first being that
        technology is a fundamental influencer on society and the way in which
        it exists, and the second being that changes in technology lead to
        changes in society. Ultimately, technology influences the choices that a
        person in a particular society makes, and the knowledge of that society.
        These changes often correlate with a change in technology.

        2012 article, he explains that technology has biases. If you throw a
        stone, thus turning it into a technology, it will have a bias which does
        not change according to the user’s intentions. In a sense, the bias of a
        technology is what a technology facilitates. This does not necessarily
        mean that technology is inherently bad, and as Marshall McLuhan said in
        his 1964 article The Medium Is The Message, “The products of modern
        science are not in themselves good or bad; it is the way they are used
        which determines their value”. Seemingly, intention plays a large role
        both from a technology designer’s perspective and a user’s perspective.
        In AI Jazeera English’s 2019 stream talk, Priyamvada Gopal said
        something interesting about colonialism and intentions:
      </p>
      <p class="p-quote">
        Just because certain things got left behind and then got used by the
        legatees of colonialism, doesn’t mean that they were done with the
        benefit of colonial subjects in mind. We have a tendency to take
        something that happened and make it positive, but that doesn’t mean that
        it was put there with a positive intention.

        Knowledge production, according to Adam Hyde (2016), has four stages,
        namely: management, creation, processing and sharing. Management refers
        to the creation of the context surrounding the information, and includes
        assigning roles, permissions, creating a table of contents, etc. In
        other technologies this would be different, however the function
        facilitates the same activities. Creation this is the production of
        content interaction interfaces (user interface), and how designers can
        must consider what they want users to do when interacting with their
        technology. Processing refers to how designers improve their content.
        This includes bringing in people with the correct expertise to optimise
        designs or bringing in people to help with the workflow. Sharing would
        be how designers incorporate their technology into other technologies,
        as well as share their technology with others.

        Techno-colonialism is an ongoing colonisation of the digital space.
        Techno-colonialism is a term coined by Randy Bush in 2015 and it
        describes “the exploitation of poorer cultures by richer ones through
        technology. In particular, this was focused on Internet technology,
        though it may apply more widely. Like ice cream, techno-colonialism
        comes in many flavors.” Bush goes on to describe different types of
        techno-colonialism, namely: classical capitalist exploitation, the
        vendor territorialist, aid agencies, the exploiting hero, the agent,
        self-exploitation, and the do-gooder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Classic capitalist exploitation is when inferior technology is sold to
        poorer countries by richer countries. The vendor territorialist attempts
        to make large segments of a society into using their technology. Aid
        agencies cooperate with others in order to further technology, but they
        become greedy and lose sight of the original goal. The exploiting hero
        brings inappropriate technology in order to gain power of personal
        leverage. The agent represents others as opposed to directly introducing
        them and involving them. Self-exploitation is a person who is being
        exploited and chooses to exploit others in their society, and finally
        the do-gooder who helps others in order to gain some sort of credit
        (personal or financial).

        Typically, during colonial rule, the colonial power controls the
        knowledge system of the society. This often meant the “intentional
        divestment of indigenous populations of power of participation” (Collier
        in Bristow, 2016). In techno-colonialism, this is primarily seen through
        the digital divide. The digital divide is “a social issues referring to
        the differing amount of information between those who have access to the
        internet, and those who do not” (Victoria, 2020). This divide became
        particularly prominent during the information age in which information
        and communication technologies became the basis for economic and social
        connectivity. Bristow, in her 2016 paper, makes an interesting point
        about how the knowledge system of technology might be controlled through
        the need to know the correct code or verbalisations:
      </p>
      <p class="p-quote">
        Pfaffenberger proposes that technology should be seen in a system of
        related social behaviours that, like cultures, are passed through the
        knowledge system… knowledge and knowhow of technology requires a
        codification or verbalisation in order to be effectively transmitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many other factors to consider when speaking about why a less
        technologically advanced country may struggle to become more advanced
        and produce their own technologies. For example, affordability,
        accessibility and software biases. People in poorer countries often
        cannot afford to buy the technology they need in order to be connected
        to the internet, and sometimes, even if the people can afford to buy the
        technology, the country’s infrastructure is inadequate and cannot
        provide stable or strong internet connection. This is a disadvantage
        when in the information age because many things are facilitated through
        the internet such as meetings, job applications, social networking and
        much more. To add to the disadvantages poorer countries face, technology
        designers may often design without considering the accessibility of
        their product, and this typically increases the digital divide. This
        includes design choices in which the designer assumes there will be
        internet connection or electricity to charge a device frequently.

        When one looks at techno-colonialism in social media it is, simply, the
        power of one technological entity to control how information is
        produced, and what information is available to audiences. Many social
        media giants, like Facebook and Twitter, have consumers all over the
        world. This has both pros and cons. Users can be socially connected, but
        due to its algorithms, users are also infrequently exposed to view
        alternative to theirs, furthermore, there is an illusion of anonymity
        when people use social media which means people are more likely to say
        or do things which are dangerous or bad. However, technology giants
        operate in the same way as colonial powers. They claim sovereignty,
        dominate other cultures and operate as if the law does not apply to
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology companies are increasingly being treated like sovereign
        nations which have the right to conduct internal affairs without the
        interference of other nations, and this is due to their economic power.
        Technology companies, design their own unique experiences for their
        users by gathering information about them and suggesting similar liked
        content. This creates a homogenous experience for users on a specific
        platform and makes users extremely similar to one another. This is what
        McLuhan predicted through his theory of the global village. This is
        where people would become very interconnected due to technology, and
        produce their own “culture”. This is not inherently bad, however,
        internet culture is dominated by white western males. A message often
        seen in colonisation is that whites, in particular males, are superior,
        and this is no different in techno-colonialism. Technology giants
        continue with this philosophy and design their products with white males
        in mind, with little regard for the diverse minorities. These types of
        cultural philosophies often dominate other cultures on the internet
        because of the user base and designers. Technology companies frequently
        operate in ways which violate laws. This is often due to capitalistic
        intentions and where the companies believe that its users are ignorant
        about the violations. Kari Paul wrote in an article about how Facebook
        was taken to court in 2020 over their poor business practises which put
        users in harm’s way:
      </p>
      <p class="p-quote">
        Over the course of 2020, users filed lawsuits against Facebook and sued
        them in 2021 for deceptive practises over disinformation on the platform
        “the lawsuit cites a variety of research that underscores how Facebook’s
        failure to put a stop to misinformation has negatively affected EU users
        and constitutes a deceptive practice
      </p>
      <p>
        With all this in mind, it seems apparent that, the poorer and less
        technologically advanced countries are controlled and exploited by the
        richer and more technologically advanced country through the gatekeeping
        of knowledge systems. Moreover, the technology that people have, changes
        how they interact with the world, and how the world interacts with them,
        thus techno-colonialism reflects technological determinism.
