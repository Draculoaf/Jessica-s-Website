        Technological determinism was first coined by Thorstein Veblen, and his
        theory around technological determinism is that technology defines a
        society’s nature, thus technology is a major influencer of society’s
        culture, and it can determine history. Langdon Winner describes the
        theory in a similar way with his two hypotheses. The first being that
        technology is a fundamental influencer on society and the way in which
        it exists, and the second being that changes in technology lead to
        changes in society. Ultimately, technology influences the choices that a
        person in a particular society makes, and the knowledge of that society.
        These changes often correlate with a change in technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a 2012 article, Veblen explains that technology has biases "if you
        throw a stone, thus turning it into a technology, it will have a bias
        which does not change according to the user’s intentions". In a sense,
        the bias of a technology is what a technology facilitates. This does not
        necessarily mean that technology is inherently bad, and as Marshall
        McLuhan said in his 1964 article The Medium Is The Message, “The
        products of modern science are not in themselves good or bad; it is the
        way they are used which determines their value”. Seemingly, intention
        plays a large role both from a technology designer’s perspective and a
        user’s perspective. In AI Jazeera English’s 2019 stream talk, Priyamvada
        Gopal said something interesting about colonialism and intentions:
      </p>
      <p class="p-quote">
        Just because certain things got left behind and then got used by the
        legatees of colonialism, doesn’t mean that they were done with the
        benefit of colonial subjects in mind. We have a tendency to take
        something that happened and make it positive, but that doesn’t mean that
        it was put there with a positive intention.
      </p>

        Techno-colonialism is an ongoing colonisation of the digital space.
        Techno-colonialism is a term coined by Randy Bush in 2015 and it
        describes “the exploitation of poorer cultures by richer ones through
        technology. In particular, this was focused on Internet technology,
        though it may apply more widely. Like ice cream, techno-colonialism
        comes in many flavors.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, during colonial rule, the colonial power controls the
        knowledge system of the society. This often meant the “intentional
        divestment of indigenous populations of power of participation” (Collier
        in Bristow, 2016). In techno-colonialism, this is primarily seen through
        the digital divide. The digital divide is “a social issues referring to
        the differing amount of information between those who have access to the
        internet, and those who do not” (Victoria, 2020). This divide became
        particularly prominent during the information age in which information
        and communication technologies became the basis for economic and social
        connectivity. Bristow, in her 2016 paper, makes an interesting point
        about how the knowledge system of technology might be controlled through
        the need to know the correct code or verbalisations:
      </p>
      <p class="p-quote">
        Pfaffenberger proposes that technology should be seen in a system of
        related social behaviours that, like cultures, are passed through the
        knowledge system… knowledge and knowhow of technology requires a
        codification or verbalisation in order to be effectively transmitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many other factors to consider when speaking about why a less
        technologically advanced country may struggle to become more advanced
        and produce their own technologies. For example, affordability,
        accessibility and software biases. People in poorer countries often
        cannot afford to buy the technology they need in order to be connected
        to the internet, and sometimes, even if the people can afford to buy the
        technology, the country’s infrastructure is inadequate and cannot
        provide stable or strong internet connection. This is a disadvantage
        when in the information age because many things are facilitated through
        the internet such as meetings, job applications, social networking and
        much more. To add to the disadvantages poorer countries face, technology
        designers may often design without considering the accessibility of
        their product, and this typically increases the digital divide. This
        includes design choices in which the designer assumes there will be
        internet connection or electricity to charge a device frequently.
