          For my first wireframes of my website, I really am focusing on
          allowing the user to move through my website without having to type or
          go through complicated tabs to find simple information. In my
          homepage, you first see the profile bar at the top which has a photo
          about me, a short bio to get personal and a LinkedIn link. This is
          because my website is about me, so I want people to really get a sense
          of who I am, what I do, etc. I think that having the short descirption
          of me written in my handwriting would make it even more personal. I
          also feel like adding a photo and bio at the top of the bar creates a
          very familiar feeling and I hope feels very welcoming.

          is what I am aiming for my homepage portfolio to look like.

          Because I want the viewers to get to know me, I also think that I want
          to put a timeline of my works (portfolio) so that people can see how
          much I have grown. There is two tabs to bring the user to my latest
          works (because it is going to be at the bottom of my timeline) OR the
          timeline will just go the other way and have my most recent works at
          the top. This is a site which I want to be professional (in the sense
          that I woud want to put this site into my portfolio for potential
          employers to see) so I want to base my colours from National
          Geographics' website. This means the main colours are going to be
          gold, white and black.
        </p>

          My page then has a navigation bar which is mostly pictures because I
          find that this is a much more appealing way of navigating through a
          website, as opposed to going through a bunch of categories, and
          because the things going on the website are simple; confusion can more
          easily be avoided. For the blog posts, I based it off of the Twitter
          design. Each post will have a title and picture of the author and with
          a “read more” function, the user can enlarge the post to see more
          text. My design page will work in a similar style except It might be a
          different colour heading from the blog posts - we are yet to see.
          Overall, I don’t want users to be met with a wall of text, and I want
          them to easily be able to traverse the space. The overall text of the
          site should be a sans-serrif font because this is the easiest font to
          read.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, I am creating my website with the idea that users should
          not have to search through my navigation bar to find things (this is
          uder the hopes that the site will become easier to navigate, and
          become more "addicting" to stay on), I chose my colour scheme to match
          National Geographic because they have created a website which makes
          the content stand out in a professional, clean, and non-overwhelming
          way, and finally I chose my font to be a sans-serrif font because it
          has the most readability.
